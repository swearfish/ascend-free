- [ ] Bottom line of shape images are cut (e.g.: scrollbar arrows)
- [ ] Some shape images can't be loaded due to weird header / size (check logs: Failed to load 2 / 68 from data\1starmap.shp: Invalid bounds (w:51, h:31, x:2147483065, y:2147483067))
- [ ] Investigate possibility of loading resources directly from COB files (no intermediate files in cache folder for shapes and waves)
- [ ] Update lists in list boxes
- [ ] Update controls at runtime
- [ ] Use mouse wheel for scrolling in lists
- [ ] Investigate transparency (e.g.: Star Cluster button or Species glyphs in New Game)
- [ ] In-memory color blending for fonts (color text is written with palette manipulation for now)
