* This project is for fun, for joy of programming
  * Not to:
    * learn anything, 
    * experiment with cutting edge tech
    * making money
    * demonstrate coding skills
    * use as reference
* Don't stick to problems
  * When you encounter a problem:
    1. Implement a workaround
    2. Record it in TODO.md
    3. Continue
  * Examples:
    * Shape file loading issues
    * Resources from COB vs using intermediate files
    * Shape transparency
* Prefer fast Edit > Run > Debug > Fail cycles over design, TDD
* Use technologies, libraries where they really help and/or you're not interested in implementation
  * Reinventing the wheel is okay if its fun
  * Get rid of any libraries that cause problems:
    * Has lots of bugs
    * Too steep learning curve
    * Dependency issues
